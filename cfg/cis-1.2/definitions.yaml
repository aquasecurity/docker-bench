       Note: If there are users in the image that are not needed, you should consider deleting

        set: true
    remediation: |
      You should manage the CPU runtime between your containers dependent on their priority
      within your organization. To do so start the container using the --cpu-shares argument.
      For example, you could run a container as below:
      docker run --interactive --tty --cpu-shares 512 centos /bin/bash
      In the example above, the container is started with CPU shares of 50% of what other
      containers use. So if the other container has CPU shares of 80%, this container will have
      CPU shares of 40%.
      Every new container will have 1024 shares of CPU by default. However, this value is shown
      as 0 if you run the command mentioned in the audit section.
      Alternatively:
      1. Navigate to the /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/system.slice/ directory.
      2. Check your container instance ID using docker ps.
      3. Inside the above directory (in step 1), you could have a directory called, for
         example: docker-<Instance ID>.scope. For example, docker-
         example: docker-<Instance ID>.scope. For example, docker-
         example: docker-<Instance ID>.scope. For example, docker-
      4. You will find a file named cpu.shares. Execute cat cpu.shares. This will always
         give you the CPU share value based on the system. Even if there are no CPU shares
         configured using the -c or --cpu-shares argument in the docker run command,
         this file will have a value of 1024.
      If you set one container's CPU shares to 512 it will receive half of the CPU time compared to
      the other containers. So if you take 1024 as 100% you can then derive the number that you
      should set for respective CPU shares. For example, use 512 if you want to set it to 50% and
      256 if you want to set it 25%.

      filesystem being mounted as read only.
      docker run <Run arguments> --read-only <Container Image Name or ID> <Command>
      Enabling the --read-only option at a container's runtime should be used by administrators
      to force a container's executable processes to only write container data to explicit storage
      locations during its lifetime.
      Examples of explicit storage locations during a container's runtime include, but are not
      limited to:
      1. Using the --tmpfs option to mount a temporary file system for non-persistent data
         writes.
      docker run --interactive --tty --read-only --tmpfs "/run" --tmpfs "/tmp"
      centos /bin/bash
      2. Enabling Docker rw mounts at a container's runtime to persist container data
         directly on the Docker host filesystem.
      docker run --interactive --tty --read-only -v /opt/app/data:/run/app/data:rw
      centos /bin/bash
      3. Utilizing Docker shared-storage volume plugins for Docker data volume to persist
         container data.
      docker volume create -d convoy --opt o=size=20GB my-named-volume
      docker run --interactive --tty --read-only -v my-named-volume:/run/app/data

         Manager installation node:
      docker volume create ucp-controller-server-certs
      2. Copy your external certificate authority's public certificate file (ca.pem) and your

      cp ca.pem cert.pem key.pem $(docker volume inspect --format '{{ .Mountpoint

      UCP cluster administrators can audit client certificate bundles on a per-user basis. You can

      MANAGEMENT | USERS interface in UCP, selecting the user from the list, clicking on the
      "Configure" button from the right-hand navigation menu, and selecting "Client Bundle"
      from the drop-down. From there, a list of client bundles assigned to the user will appear.
      This page also allows administrators to revoke client certificate bundles when necessary.

      Client certificate bundles can be created in one of two ways:
      User Management UI
      UCP Administrators can provision client certificate bundles on behalf of users by navigating
      to the USER MANAGEMENT | USERS interface in UCP, selecting the user from the list,
      clicking on the "Configure" button from the right-hand navigation, and selecting "Client
      Bundle" from the drop-down. The "New Client Bundle" link can be selected to create a
      client bundle. This will trigger a download of the bundle as a .zip file.
      Self-Provision
      Users with access to the UCP console can create client certificate bundles themselves. After
      logging into the console, the user can select their username drop-down from the top-left
      corner of the navigation page and select the "My Profile" option. From there, the "New
      Client Bundle" link can be selected to create a client bundle and this will trigger a download
